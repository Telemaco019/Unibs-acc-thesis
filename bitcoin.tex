\section{Bitcoin}
Bitcoin it's the first fully decentralized cryptocurrency. It was invented by
Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and it was the first real implementation of Blockchain.

In Bitcoin the users can exchange currency over the network just as it can be
done with conventional currency. However, unlike traditional currencies, bitcoins
are enterely virtual and thus there are no physical coins. In particular, there
are not even virtual coins since they are implied in the transactions that send
value from a sender to a receiver.

We present solutions to the anonymity problem for both transactions on Bitcoin's blockchain and off the blockchain (in so called micropayment channel networks). We use an untrusted third party to issue anonymous vouchers which users redeem for Bitcoin. Blind signatures and Bitcoin transaction contracts (aka smart contracts) ensure the anonymity and fairness during the bitcoin                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}leftrightarrow {\$}{\$}                   voucher exchange.

abstract="The increasing popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has made scalability a primary and urgent concern. We analyze how fundamental and circumstantial bottlenecks in Bitcoin limit the ability of its current peer-to-peer overlay network to support substantially higher throughputs and lower latencies. Our results suggest that reparameterization of block size and intervals should be viewed only as a first increment toward achieving next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols, and major advances will additionally require a basic rethinking of technical approaches. We offer a structured perspective on the design space for such approaches. Within this perspective, we enumerate and briefly discuss a number of recently proposed protocol ideas and offer several new ideas and open challenges.",

We then present our novel pure Proof of Stake protocols, and argue that they help in mitigating problems that the existing protocols exhibit.",

abstract="Bitcoin prevents double-spending using the blockchain, a public ledger kept with every client. Every single transaction till date is present in this ledger. Due to this, true anonymity is not present in bitcoin. We present a method to enhance anonymity in bitcoin-type cryptocurrencies. In the blockchain, each block holds a list of transactions linking the sending and receiving addresses. In our modified protocol the transactions (and blocks) do not contain any such links. Using this, we obtain a far higher degree of anonymity. Our method uses a new primitive known as composite signatures. Our security is based on the hardness of the Computation Diffie-Hellman assumption in bilinear maps.",

abstract="An untraceable payments system based on an extension of public key cryptography, called blind signatures, has been presented previously by the author. The existence of such blind signature systems was not demonstrated. An actual set of implementable functions is presented in the present work which have the blind signature property, and for which the blindness of the signature is proved without any assumptions about computational infeasibility. In terms of the simple payments system previously presented, this means that even a conspiracy between the bank and payee can learn nothing from their participation in the payments protocol about the identity of the payer.",

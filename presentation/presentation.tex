%    \framesubtitle{Distributed systems}
%      The desired properties of a distributed system are the %following:\vspace{10pt}
%      \begin{itemize}
%        \item \textbf{Consistency}: all the nodes have the same %lates available copy of the data.
%        \item \textbf{Availability}: the system is always working %and responding to the
%        input requests without any failures.
%        \item \textbf{Partition tolerance}: if a group of nodes %fails the distributed system
%        still continues to operate correctly
%      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Distributed system}
    A \textcolor{red}{distributed system} is a network that consists of autonomous nodes,
    connected using a distribution middleware, which acts in a coordinated way
    (passing messages to each other) in order to achieve a common outcome and
    that can be seen by the user as a single logical platform.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}


  \begin{frame}{Introduction}
    Even if some of the nodes fault or links break, a distributed system should tolerate
    this and should continue to work correctly. There are two types of fault:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Simple node crash
      \item Exhibition of malicious or inconsistent behavior arbitrarily: \red{Byzantine fault}
    \end{itemize}

    \pause 
    \begin{block}{Byzantine nodes}
      A \textcolor{red}{Byzantine node} is a node that has an arbitrary behavior,
      which can even be malicious.
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Introduction}
        \begin{block}{The Byzantine generals problem}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Problem formulated by Leslie Lamport \cite{lamport1982byzantine}
            \item A group of generals are surrounding a city and they have to agree
            on a common decision: attack or retreat.
            \item Their only communication way is a messenger
            \item Some of the generals may be \emph{traitors}: they communicate
            misleading message for preventing the loyal generals from reaching an
            agreement
            \item Requirement: algorithm that allows the loyal generals to agree
            on the same plan regardless of traitors general
          \end{itemize}
        \end{block}

  \begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Consensus}
      \red{Consensus} is the process of agreement between untrusted nodes on a data
      value.
    \end{block}

    \pause
    Requirements for a consensus algorithm:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Agreement}: non-byzantine nodes must agree on the same value
      \item \textbf{Termination}: the consensus process must come to an end (nodes
      have to reach a decision)
      \item \textbf{Validity}: the agreed value must have been proposed by at
      least one honest node
      \item \textbf{Fault tolerance}: the consensus algorithm must work even
      in the presence of one or more Byzantine nodes
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  
  
  
  \subsection{Definition}
  \begin{frame}{What is Blockchain}
    \begin{block}{Business definition}
      Blockchain is a platform whereby peers can exchange values without the need
      for a central trusted party by using transactions which are stored inside
      the platform in a verifiable and permanent way.
    \end{block}
    
    \pause
    \begin{block}{Technical definition}
      Blockchain is a distributed ledger that is
      \begin{itemize}
        \item cryptographically secure
        \item append-only
        \item immutable (extremely hard to change)
        \item updateable only via consensus among nodes
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}



  \subsection{Features}
  \begin{frame}{Blockchain features}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Decentralization}: no need of a central trusted entity
      which stores the data and validates the transaction \pause
      \item \textbf{Distributed consensus}: high Byzantine Fault
      Tolerance, for each data value there's only a single version agreed by all
      parties through a consensus algorithm \pause
      \item \textbf{High availability}: Blockchain is based on a peer-to-peer
      network and data replicated on each node: even if one or more nodes fail
      the whole network can continue to work correctly
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Blockchain features (Cont.)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Immutability}: once a block has been added to the blockchain,
      changing it is computationally infeasible \pause
      \item \textbf{Transparency}: every node can see what is in the blockchain \pause
      \item \textbf{Security}: integrity of data, authentication and non-repudiation
      are ensured. Confidentiality is not provided. Security is a consequence of
      the distributed nature of Blockchain \pause
      \item \textbf{Uniqueness}: every transaction is unique and has not been spent already
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}



  \subsection{Structure}
  \begin{frame}{Blockchain structure}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Linked list of ordered fixed-length \red{blocks}
      \item Each block includes a set of \red{transactions}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[!htb]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{../img/blockchain-basic-schema.png}
    \end{figure}
  \end{frame}

          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{../img/blockchain-basic-schema.png}
        \end{figure}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item  A block is a group of transactions. Generally, it is composed of:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item[-] a set of transactions
          \item[-] a hash which identifies the block
          \item[-] a pointer to the previous block hash
          \item[-] a nonce
          \item[-] a timestamp
        \end{itemize}
        \item The first block in the blockchain is called \red{genesis block}.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}




  \begin{frame}{Blockchain structure}
    \framesubtitle{Nodes, addresses and transactions}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Nodes} are active entities which store a copy of the blockchain and can
      perform and/or validate transactions \pause
      \item \textbf{Addresses} are unique identifiers which identify the parties involved in a
      transaction and usually are a public key or are derived from a public key. \pause
      \item \textbf{Transactions} are transfers of value from an address to another. \pause
      \item \textbf{Transaction scripts} are predefined sets of commands for nodes to transfer
      values from one address to another and perform various other functions.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}



  \subsection{Consensus}
  \begin{frame}{Consensus in Blockchain}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Required to establish whether the ledger itself or new blocks are
        valid or not
        \item Analogy with the Byzantine Generals Problem:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-]``generals'' are the nodes of the Blockchain
            \item[-]``messengers'' are the network links
            \item[-]``traitors'' are malicious nodes which try to tamper with the data
        \end{itemize} 
      \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Consensus in Blockchain}
      Consensus mechanisms commonly used in Blockchain:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (\textbf{PBFT})
        \item Proof of Work (\textbf{PoW})
        \item Proof of Stake (\textbf{PoS})
        \item Delegated Proof of Stake (\textbf{DPoS})
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{frame}




  \begin{frame}{Consensus in Blockchain}
    \framesubtitle{Common Consensus mechanisms}
    \begin{block}{1) Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Algorithm proposed by M. Castro and B. Liskov as an optimized
        solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem \cite{castro1999practical} 
        \item Each ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù maintains an internal state. When he receives a
        message, he uses it in conjunction with his internal state to
        run a computation which tells what to think about the message in question 
        \item  After reaching his individual decision about the message,
        the general shares that decision with all the other ‚Äúgenerals‚Äù in the system 
        \item  A consensus decision is determined based on the total decisions
        submitted by all generals \pause
        \item \textcolor{green}{Pro}: very efficient \pause
        \item \red{Cons}: precludes users anonymity \pause
        \item Mechanism adopted by Hyperledger and Ripple
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}




  \begin{frame}{Consensus in Blockchain}
    \framesubtitle{Common Consensus mechanisms}
    \begin{block}{2) Proof of Work}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Contrary to the PBFT, it doesn‚Äôt require all nodes to submit
        their individual conclusions 
        \item Based on a proof that ensures that enough computational resources have
        been spent before proposing a block for acceptance by the network 
        \item Only a single node (the first one who solves the PoW) announces its
        block 
        \item The announced blocks can be independently verified by all
        the nodes in the system \pause
        \item Mechanism adopted by Bitcoin
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}





  \begin{frame}{Consensus in Blockchain}
    \framesubtitle{Common Consensus mechanisms}
    \begin{block}{3) Proof of Stake}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Contrary to PoW, there isn't any individual attempting to carry out
        an intensive computation in order to propose a block 
        \item The network runs a lottery based on the nodes‚Äô stake to decide
        who will announce a block 
        \item The more stake one node has, the higher the probability
        to be chosen is 
        \item \textcolor{green}{Main idea}: if a node that has enough stake in the system it means
        that it has invested enough in the system \MVRightarrow\, any malicious
        attempt/attack on the system wouldn't have any benefits for him \pause
        \item \red{Main problem}: the system rewards more those who already are most
        deeply involved in the network \MVRightarrow\, the system becomes always
        more centralized
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}





  \begin{frame}{Consensus in Blockchain}
    \framesubtitle{Common Consensus mechanisms}
    \begin{block}{4) Delegated Proof of Stake}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Evolution of the PoS 
        \item Each node that has stake in the system can choose an entity to
        represent its portion of stake in the system (by voting) 
        \item The more stake one node has, the higher is the weight of his vote 
        \item The entity with most votes (weighted) becomes a delegate which
        proposes blocks 
        \item The voting process is periodically executed: if the current delegate
        doesn't behave correctly the other nodes just stop voting it
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}



  \subsection{Types of Blockchain}
  \begin{frame}{Types of Blockchain}
    \begin{block}{1) Public Blockchain}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Blockchain open to the public in which everyone can join the network,
        maintain the shared ledger and participate in the consensus process 
        \item The ledger is not owned by anyone and everyone can read it 
        \item Usually there's an incentive mechanism to encourage more participants
        to join the network \pause
        \item \red{Main problem}: lack of privacy (everyone can see the transactions
        stored in the blockchain) \pause
        \item Bitcoin is based on a public blockchain
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}




  \begin{frame}{Types of Blockchain (Cont. 1)}
    \begin{block}{2) Private Blockchain}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Open only to an organization or a group of individuals
        \item Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join the Blockchain and maintain the ledger
        \item Usually the network is permissioned: restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and only in certain transactions 
        \item Example of private Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric \cite{hyperledger-fabric}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}




  \begin{frame}{Types of Blockchain (Cont. 2)}
    \begin{block}{3) Consortium Blockchain}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Consensus process is controlled by a preselected set of nodes (e.g. a consortium of organizations, each of which operates a node) 
        \item The right to read the blockchain might be public or permissioned 
        \item Example of consortium Blockchain: R3 \cite{R3}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

  \section{Bitcoin}
  \subsection{What is Bitcoin}
  \begin{frame}{What is Bitcoin}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item First fully decentralized cryptocurrency 
      \item Invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008: first real implementation of
      Blockchain 
      \item Bitcoin can be either defined as a protocol, a digital currency
      and a platform: 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Bitcoin (capital B)  \MVRightarrow\, Bitcoin protocol
        \item bitcoin (lowercase b) \MVRightarrow\, bitcoin  currency
      \end{itemize} \pause
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{The reference implementation}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Bitcoin is an open source project and is developed by a community of volunteers
        \item The reference implementation is \textbf{Bitcoin Core}
        \item It is considered the authoritative implementation and it specifies
        how each part of the system has to be implemented.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}




  \begin{frame}{What is Bitcoin (Cont. 1)}
    Bitcoin can be seen as a combination of:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item a decentralized peer-to-peer-network (the Bitcoin protocol)
      \item a public transaction ledger (the blockchain) 
      \item a set of rules for validating transactions (consensus rules) 
      \item a mechanism for reaching distributed consensus on the blockchain
      (distributed consensus algorithm) 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}





  \begin{frame}{What is Bitcoin (Cont. 2)}
    Bitcoins are entirely ``virtual'':
    \begin{itemize}
      \item there aren't any physical or virtual coins stored anywhere 
      \item the coins are implied in the transactions that send value from a sender to
      a receiver
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}





  \subsection{Scripts}
  \begin{frame}{Bitcoin scripts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Script = list of instructions recorded with each transaction that describes
      how the next person wanting to spend the Bitcoins being transferred can gain access to them \pause 
      \item Programming language used: ``\red{Script}'' \cite{script-bitcoin-wiki} 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item very simple programming language 
        \item not Turing-complete {\tiny(no loops and no complex control flow instructions)} 
        \item deliberately disegned like this for avoiding abuses of the scripts
        for conducting denial of service attacks {\tiny(each scripts has to be
        executed on each node of the network)}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}




  \subsection{Keys and addresses}
  \begin{frame}{Keys and addresses}
    \begin{itemize}

          \item digital keys
          \item Bitcoin addresses
          \item digital signatures
      \end{itemize} 
      \item In order to be included in the blockchain, transactions require a valid
      signature which can be generated only with a private (secret) key 
      \item The private key proves the ownership of bitcoins by signing transactions and
      transferring value from a user to another \pause
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Analogy with traditional banking}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item public key \MVRightarrow\, bank account number
        \item private key \MVRightarrow\, secret PIN (or signature on a check)
        which which allows to unlock the value and transferring it to other people
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}





  \begin{frame}{Keys and addresses (Cont. 1)}
    \begin{block}{Addresses}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item unique strings of digits and characters which identify the originator and/or the destination of a transaction \pause
        \item derived from public keys through one-way cryptographic hashing:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Double hashing: SHA-256 + RIPEMD160
          \item 160-bit hash as result
          \item Base58Check encoding of the 160-bit hash
          \item Result: 26-35 characters string which begins with ‚Äú1‚Äù (\red{public key

  \begin{frame}{Keys and addresses (Cont. 2)}
    \begin{block}{Keys}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Private keys are 256-bit random numbers and can be represented
        in different formats \pause
        \item Public keys are generated starting from the private keys using
        elliptic curve multiplication: \pause
        \begin{itemize}
          \item ``Trap door'' function 
          \item Elliptic curve  specified by the secp256k1 standard, defined by the NIST:
          \[ y^2 \bmod p = (x^3 + 7) \bmod p \]
          where $p = 2^{256} ‚Äì 2^{32} ‚Äì 2^9 ‚Äì 2^8 ‚Äì 2^7 ‚Äì 2^6 ‚Äì 2^4 ‚Äì 1$ is a very large prime number 
          \item Public key $K=k*G$, where $k$ is the private key and $G$ is
          a point on the curve defined by the standard 
          \item The generator point $G$ is always the same for all Bitcoin users
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  \end{frame}





  \begin{frame}{Keys and addresses (Cont. 3)}
    \begin{block}{Public key formats}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Uncompressed format}: the key is the coordinates pair
        $(x,y)$ of a point on the curve \MVRightarrow\, prefix $04$ followed by
        two 256-bit numbers (65 Bytes) \pause
        \item \textbf{Compressed format}: prefix $03$ (if the y-coordinate is an
        odd number) or $02$ (if the y-coordinate is an even number) followed

      How to enhance Bitcoin anonymity? Two main approaches:
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item Mixing services
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[\MVRightarrow] efficient

          \item Cryptographic extensions of Bitcoin
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[\MVRightarrow] no need to trust third parties
              \item[\MVRightarrow] lower performance
              \item[\MVRightarrow] new cryptocurrencies \footnote{e.g. ZeroCoin \cite{miers2013zerocoin} and ZeroCash \cite{sasson2014zerocash}} or Bitcoin-compatible

  \section{Bitcoin Scalability}
  \subsection{Overview}
  \begin{frame}{Bitcoin Scalability Overview}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Increasing adoption of Bitcoin \MVRightarrow ability to scale received a lot of attention 
          \item Main concerns:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item can blockchain-based cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) scale-up and reach the performance of traditional payment processor? 
              \item what does it take to get there? 
          \end{enumerate}
          \pause
          \item Current Bitcoin performance: 
          \begin{itemize}
              \item around 10 min to confirm a transaction 
              \item maximum block size = 1 MB (average size = 800 KB) \cite{current-block-size}
              \item maximum throughput of 7 transactions/sec \cite{wikipedia_scalability_2018}
              \item throughput limited by max block size and block interval
          \end{itemize} \pause
          \item Comparison with Visa credit cards \cite{wikipedia_scalability_2018}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item 2000 transactions/sec on average
              \item peaks of 56 000 transactions/sec

  \begin{frame}{Bitcoin Scalability Overview}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Idea for increasing throughput: \textbf{reparametrization}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[-] decrease blocks interval
              \item[-] increase block maximum size (currently 1 MB)
          \end{itemize}
          \item Great debate
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[\MVRightarrow] \textcolor{red}{Main cons.}: less decentralization
              \item[\MVRightarrow] better to optimize the current block space available 
          \end{itemize}
          \item In \cite{croman-scaling-blockchain}, the author shows that: 
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[-] reparametrization alone cannot address Bitcoin scaling
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item[\MVRightarrow] parameters limitations
                  \item[\MVRightarrow] other bottlenecks in the Bitcoin system

  \subsection{Reparametrization limitations}
  \begin{frame}{Metrics definitions}
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item ``X\% block propagation delay'' = time required for X\% of the nodes to receive a full block
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[\MVRightarrow] it's calculated empirically
          \end{itemize}
          \item $\text{``X\% effective throughput''} = \frac{\text{block size}}{\text{X\% block propagation delay}}$
      \end{enumerate}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item transaction rate $>$ X\% effective throughput $\rightarrow$ (100 -X)\% of the nodes unable to receive blocks as they arrive
      \end{itemize}
  \end{frame} 
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Limits}
    Premises:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item current level of decentralization has to be maintained 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\MVRightarrow] at least 90\% of properly working nodes
        \end{itemize}
        \item current Bitcoin peer-to-peer network is used, no changes to it 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\MVRightarrow] any change to the network would affect the X\% effective throughput
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Throughput limit}
        \[ \text{90\% block propagation delay} < \text{block interval} \]
        namely 
        \[ \frac{\text{block size}}{\text{90\% effective throughput}} < \text{block interval} \]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\MVRightarrow] \footnote{assuming block interval = 10 min} block size not more than 4 MB, e.g max throughput = 27 transactions/sec 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

  \begin{frame}{Limits (Cont. 1)}
      \begin{block}{Block interval limit}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reducing block interval = lower latency 
            \item Reducing block interval \MVRightarrow block size has to be reduced as well (due to throughput limit equation)
            \item Block size too small \MVRightarrow network bandwidth is not fully used
            \item Result of experiments/measurements of \cite{croman-scaling-blockchain}: block interval not smaller then 12 seconds in order to: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[-] have at least 90\% effective throughput
                \item[-] fully utilize the network bandwidth

          \item Function: propagate messages corresponding to valid transactions
          \item Bitcoin protocol does not fully use the available bandwidth
          \item Two main inefficiencies: 
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item before propagating a transaction, a node has to fully receive it and validate it (for avoiding Dos)
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item[\MVRightarrow] \textcolor{green}{possible solution}: low-latency broadcast protocols, nodes allowed to rate-limit transmissions from their peers
              \end{itemize}
              \pause
              \item first transactions are propagated (creation of pools), then blocks are propagated: some transactions are transmitted twice
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item[\MVRightarrow] \textcolor{green}{possible solution}: set reconciliation protocol (single transactions pools are similar)

              \item[-] tradeoff between consensus speed, bandwidth and security
          \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
          \item Function: store the Bitcoin ledger and support \texttt{read} and \texttt{write} operations
          \item Main issue: each node stores a copy of the entire Blockchain
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[-] in June 2018 it was 178 GB \cite{statista}
              \item[-] it grows exponentially
          \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  
  
  \begin{frame}{View Plane}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Function: allows miners to mine without storing the full copy of the Blockchain
          \begin{itemize}
              \item[-] they operate on a \emph{view} of the ledger: UTXO set
              \item[-] UTXO set specifies the current balance of all the entities
              \item[-] UTXO set has to be computed
          \end{itemize}
          \item Main issue: computing the view takes a lot of time \item \textcolor{green}{Possible solution}: storing the view in the Storage Plane
